# Learn-jQuery
This is the start of the jQuery learning. It was complicated at first but now will focus more on simplification for simple concepts to build on.

The first learning concept was chosen to be 'Selectors'. However, the learning concepts covered were 'Selectors' as well as 'Events and Event Handlers' and 'Functions'.
